## Profile

Hey there! I'm a full-stack dev who's been rocking JavaScript since the early days (front-end from 2011-2016). I love building cool apps with tech like Node, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, GraphQL, React, React Native, Vue, and Lit. I also jam with frameworks like Express, Svelte, NestJS, and NuxtJS. Got a knack for serverless magic on AWS and GCP, whether native or with the Serverless framework.

I excel at architecting and scaling distributed systems, whether it's microservices, serverless setups, monoliths, or hybrid solutions, depending on what’s best for the job. Always on the lookout for the latest and greatest tech to play with.

- **Cloud:** Many services in AWS, GCP, and Firebase.
- **Third-Party Integrations:** Hooking up ElasticSearch, Algolia for search magic, Stripe, and Braintree for seamless payments
- **Testing and CI/CD:** Big fan of Unit, Integration, and End-to-End testing (Puppeteer, Playwright, Cypress). Love setting up slick CI/CD pipelines with ADO, Gitlab, Github, AWS, and GCP.
- **E-commerce Systems:** Hands-on with big enterprise e-commerce projects, front to back.
- **Legacy Systems:** Got the chops to handle and revamp legacy codebases.
